## 🎭 Origin Story

This project was born from a common TRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) scenario: **What happens when the Game Master forgets to specify the time period and location?** 

Instead of breaking character, I turned this "bug" into a feature—players must now deduce the historical period and geographical location through careful observation and reasoning to survive and escape the dimensional maze.

<br>

## 🎯 Concept: Active Learning Through Gamification

### The Problem with Traditional Education
- Passive lectures often fail to engage students
- Historical and geographical knowledge feels disconnected from real problem-solving
- Students memorize facts without developing analytical thinking

### My Gamified Solution
This quiz system transforms learning into an **active investigation game** where:
- **Production Teams** craft challenging, misleading scenarios with subtle clues
- **Investigation Teams** must use critical thinking and knowledge synthesis
- **Competition dynamics** naturally emerge, driving deeper engagement

<br>

## 🎮 Try It Out
🌌 [Play the Demo](https://trgr-karasutoragara.github.io/time-space-quiz-game/)

Experience the time-space labyrinth yourself! No installation required—just open in your browser and start solving temporal mysteries.

<br>

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Mysterious Scenario**: Players find themselves in an unknown time/place
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Analyze cultural artifacts, language, technology, political references
3. **Deductive Reasoning**: Synthesize clues while avoiding red herrings
4. **High Stakes**: Wrong answers trap players deeper in the time-space labyrinth

### Question Categories
- 📜 **Historical Periods**: Ancient civilizations, political transitions, cultural shifts
- 🗺️ **Geography**: Trade routes, colonial territories, cultural regions  
- 🎭 **Cultural Context**: Literature, art movements, social customs
- 🔤 **Linguistic Challenges**: Etymology, nuanced word usage (bonus rounds)

<br>

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Randomized Content System
```javascript
// Quiz database with multiple question types
const quizDatabase = [
  {
    type: 'history',
    title: 'Ancient Babylon Temple',
    description: 'Cuneiform, ziggurats, Marduk worship...',
    // Intentional red herrings included
  }
  // ... more scenarios
];
```

### Progressive Difficulty
- **Beginner**: Clear historical markers
- **Intermediate**: Mixed cultural evidence  
- **Expert**: Subtle contradictions and linguistic traps
- **Bonus**: Advanced language differentiation

<br>

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Retro-Futuristic Aesthetics
- **80s Terminal Vibes**: Green phosphor text, scan lines, CRT glow effects
- **Cosmic Themes**: Stars, dimensional warping, time-space distortion
- **Immersive Typography**: Monospace fonts, retro color schemes

### Psychological Engagement
- **Mystery**: Unknown circumstances create natural curiosity
- **Competition**: Team-based challenges drive motivation
- **Achievement**: Point systems and success tracking
- **Flow State**: Balanced difficulty progression

<br>

## 🌍 Educational Applications

### Classroom Implementation
1. **Preparation Phase**: Teacher teams create scenario databases
2. **Competition Mode**: Student teams rotate between creation and solving
3. **Analysis Phase**: Discuss reasoning, evaluate evidence quality
4. **Iteration**: Refine scenarios based on student performance

### Skill Development
- **Critical Thinking**: Analyzing contradictory evidence
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying historical/cultural markers
- **Research Skills**: Connecting scattered clues
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Team-based deduction

<br>

## 🔧 Current Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for progress tracking
- **Design**: Responsive, terminal-inspired UI
- **Animations**: CSS keyframes for atmospheric effects

### Language Note
This prototype uses Japanese for historical/cultural content focusing on:
- Japanese history (Heian → Kamakura transition, Meiji Restoration)
- World history (Babylonian Empire, Byzantine Empire, Age of Exploration)
- Cultural knowledge (Classical literature, art movements)
- Linguistic nuances (English etymology, usage differentiation)

<br>

## 🌱 Natural Growth

### If You Enjoy This...
The beauty of open source is organic evolution. If this concept resonates with you and your friends, natural extensions might emerge:

- **Your Language/Culture**: Adapt scenarios for your own historical context
- **Your Subject**: Apply the mystery-solving format to literature, science, art, etc.
- **Your Classroom**: Use it as-is or modify for your teaching style
- **Your Ideas**: The framework is simple enough to hack and experiment with

### Community-Driven Development
No roadmaps, no promises—just the hope that if people find value in this approach, they'll:
- Share their own question databases
- Create variants for different subjects
- Report what works (or doesn't) in their context
- Build upon the concept in unexpected ways

<br>

## 📚 Academic Foundation

### Learning Theory Background
This approach naturally aligns with:
- **Active Learning**: Students investigate rather than memorize
- **Problem-Based Learning**: Real scenarios require practical knowledge
- **Gamification**: Mystery and challenge drive engagement
- **Collaborative Discovery**: Teams work together to solve puzzles

<br>

## 🤝 If You Want to Experiment

### For Fellow Educators
- Try creating scenarios for your own subject area
- Adapt questions for your local history/culture
- Let me know what works in your classroom (no pressure!)

### For Code Tinkerers
- The code is simple and hackable
- Feel free to improve the UI or add features
- Share your modifications if you think others might enjoy them

### For Curious Researchers
- Test it in your educational context
- I'd love to hear about unexpected use cases
- Document what you discover (or what breaks!)

## 🎯 Simple Vision

**Sometimes the best learning happens when you don't realize you're learning.**

This started as a silly TRPG problem and became a fun way to practice historical reasoning. If it helps someone else turn boring facts into engaging mysteries, that's already a success.

The framework is intentionally simple—no complex dependencies, no server requirements, just a browser and curiosity.
